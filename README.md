## About Me

\# &nbsp; Hello! I'm a web programmer specializing in PHP and Laravel, and I'm currently expanding my skill set by learning Python. With a strong foundation in back-end development, I enjoy creating efficient, scalable, and secure web applications. I thrive on tackling complex problems and continuously improving my coding practices. I also have experience in e-learning development.

\# &nbsp; I have a blog **0x0000001a** where I share my notes and insights on web development. Check it out [here](https://0x0000001a.cbrwvy.ru).
